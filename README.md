# ShellExecutor

### Utility that supports executing shell scripts from Java.

It provides a clean interface, QoL features and solves several issues such as:
- handling of both output streams (stdout and stderr)
- handling quote characters in commands
- providing commands as whole Strings instead of indefinite number of arguments
